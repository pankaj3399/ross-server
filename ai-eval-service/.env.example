# Server Configuration

# Set to 0.0.0.0 to accept connections from any IP
HOST=0.0.0.0

# Server port
PORT=8000

# Environment mode
ENV=production

# Memory Optimization
# Maximum concurrent requests (default: 2)
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=2

# Maximum requests before auto-restart (default: 1000)
# Uvicorn will restart the worker after this many requests to prevent memory leaks
MAX_REQUESTS=1000

# Evaluation Configuration

# Lightweight evaluation mode (default: true)
# When true, uses lighter-weight models to reduce memory usage
LIGHTWEIGHT_EVAL_MODE=true

# Toxicity batch size
# Number of responses to process in a single batch
TOXICITY_BATCH_SIZE=1

# Available classifiers:
#   - "toxigen": Lightweight model (default in lightweight mode, lower memory usage)
#   - "detoxify_unbiased": Full model (default in full mode, more accurate but uses more memory)
#
# You can specify multiple classifiers separated by commas
# Example: TOXICITY_CLASSIFIERS=toxigen,detoxify_unbiased
# Leave empty to use defaults based on LIGHTWEIGHT_EVAL_MODE
